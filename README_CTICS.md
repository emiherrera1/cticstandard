## 🔍 What Is CTICS?

CTICS is a six-level hierarchical taxonomy built to classify digital content units across platforms, styles, and formats. It is designed for use by researchers, creators, platforms, investors, and institutions to bring clarity, rigor, and interoperability to the content ecosystem.

> If GICS is for industries and Dewey is for libraries, CTICS is for Creators.
